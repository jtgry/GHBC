        title: "Worship Minister || Student Minister"
        text: "I am the worship minister and student minister here with the Good Hope family. I have thoroughly enjoyed serving here for the past 16 years in a bi-vocational position. I’m also one of the managers for a Montgomery business.  I’ve been married for 35 years to a precious lady, Vicki. We have one daughter, Courtney, who is married, where she and her husband, Matthew, are serving the Lord in Gulf Shores, AL. My desire in ministry is two-fold: to disciple and mentor those who know the Lord in our church, to be all that the Lord wants them to be, so that our community of believers can grow together and make a difference for the Kingdom; and to communicate the Gospel to those outside of our body of believers, who don’t know Jesus, as their Lord and Savior."
