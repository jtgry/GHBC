> Our mission is to glorify God, to reach people with His truth and love and to equip believers to become fully devoted followers of Jesus Christ.

Our mission at Good Hope Baptist Church is “Beyond These Walls.” This is developed by having a vision outside of ourselves. We grow this vision through our mission to exalt God’s greatness, evangelize God’s people, equip God’s people and express God’s love through our Lord Jesus Christ.

* The bible is divinely inspired and is the complete revelation of God to Man.
* There is one and only living and true God and He reveals Himself to us as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
* Man was created in the image of God. By his free choice, man sinned against God and sin entered the human race.
* Only by God’s grace can man enter into a holy fellowship and fulfill his creative purpose.
* Salvation is offered freely to all who accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.
* The Church is the New Testament local body of baptized believers.
* This church is autonomous and operates under the leadership of Jesus Christ.
* God in His time, and in His way, will one day bring this world to it's end.
* It is the duty of the church to make disciples at home and abroad.
